					<h2>Ben Tanner     (Team Role)</h3>
						<p>My career for the last 15yrs has been in cooking and am a qualified chef.</p>
						<p>My hobbies were in gaming, like World of warcraft, League of Legends, mobile games and a physical card game called Mtg. At the moment I donâ€™t have any active hobbies.</p>
						<p>IT has always interested me due to its flexibility in what you can do with it as a career. My main interests in IT were gaming and I would still like to investigate it, but now it more along the lines of robotics. I studied electronics in High school and built my own robot and have always wanted to go back to it.</p>
						<p>I have not had much exposure to IT besides friends, games and building my own PC. </p>

					<h2>David Denholm     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I have been into gaming and various tech since I was about 8 and my dad bought a Nintendo Entertainment System home.
					At various points of my childhood, I would disassemble various items, (Radios and pcs etc) and learn how they work before reassembling them.</p>
					<p>I left school after year 10 because I was bored. I took up cabinetmaking and moved towards some hands-on work.
					I started learning some LUA through and forum and started making some basic add-ons for a game.</p>
					<p>My grandma was an artist, I did not consider myself one until I started my hand at software development.
					This was my form of art.
					I am looking to advance my knowledge and skills in this area.</p>

					<h2>Jacob Daniels     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I am currently a warehouse manager in Tasmania, and most of my work experience has been in either warehousing or sales.</p>
					<p>I have always had a general interest in IT, starting from video games at a young age. When I finished high school, I took on an electrical apprenticeship, and therefore strayed away from any education or IT related jobs. </p>
					<p>Now that I have a stable job, and more free time to pursue my passion, I have decided to pursue a career in software development. I have reasonable skills programming in Java, but other than that I am completely new to the world of IT. </p>

					<h2>Dr Stephen Chung     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I am a practicing medical specialist and senior consultant physician in rehabilitation medicine for over 15 years. I also graduated from my Master degree in Health Administration (M.H.A.) at UNSW, and further pursued my interests in studying in pain medicine & management as well as assistive equipment & technology for my patients with variety of impairments and disabilities. I am also a licensed real estate agent and an auctioneer.</p>
					<p>I enjoy indoor sports like squash, table tennis and badminton, as well as outdoor sports like snow skiing. I also enjoy my quiet time watching good movies and TV shows, and of course traveling with my family and friends. My latest hobby is about to start my veggie patch. I also speak fluent Cantonese.</p>
					<p>My curiosity in I.T. was reignited from my early interests in personal computing and computer language BASIC in 1980s when I got my email address with Hotmail in 1990s, and wondered not only how world wide web worked but how â€˜wwwâ€™ would take our future into.</p>
					<p>In my medical practice in rehabilitation medicine, I expose to pioneering technology in healthcare for patients, from emerging personal assistive technology to automation and integration into living environment. I also researched the use of interactive computer assistive technology such as Nintendo VViiTM and XBOXTM for my patientsâ€™ therapy with some but limited success, and concluded that it was partly due to inappropriate user interface.</p>
					<p>I tried and changed over to Makey MakeyTM and adapted the user interface to suit my patientsâ€™ limited abilities and achieved better outcomes. Therefore, I would like to explore further in user interface in I.T. industry for my patient cohort. </p>

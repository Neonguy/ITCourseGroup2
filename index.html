					<h2>Ben Tanner     (Team Role)</h3>
						<p>My career for the last 15yrs has been in cooking and am a qualified chef.</p>
						<p>My hobbies were in gaming, like World of warcraft, League of Legends, mobile games and a physical card game called Mtg. At the moment I don’t have any active hobbies.</p>
						<p>IT has always interested me due to its flexibility in what you can do with it as a career. My main interests in IT were gaming and I would still like to investigate it, but now it more along the lines of robotics. I studied electronics in High school and built my own robot and have always wanted to go back to it.</p>
						<p>I have not had much exposure to IT besides friends, games and building my own PC. </p>

					<h2>David Denholm     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I have been into gaming and various tech since I was about 8 and my dad bought a Nintendo Entertainment System home.
					At various points of my childhood, I would disassemble various items, (Radios and pcs etc) and learn how they work before reassembling them.</p>
					<p>I left school after year 10 because I was bored. I took up cabinetmaking and moved towards some hands-on work.
					I started learning some LUA through and forum and started making some basic add-ons for a game.</p>
					<p>My grandma was an artist, I did not consider myself one until I started my hand at software development.
					This was my form of art.
					I am looking to advance my knowledge and skills in this area.</p>

					<h2>Jacob Daniels     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I am currently a warehouse manager in Tasmania, and most of my work experience has been in either warehousing or sales.</p>
					<p>I have always had a general interest in IT, starting from video games at a young age. When I finished high school, I took on an electrical apprenticeship, and therefore strayed away from any education or IT related jobs. </p>
					<p>Now that I have a stable job, and more free time to pursue my passion, I have decided to pursue a career in software development. I have reasonable skills programming in Java, but other than that I am completely new to the world of IT. </p>

					<h2>Dr Stephen Chung     (Team Role)</h3>
					<p>I am a practicing medical specialist and senior consultant physician in rehabilitation medicine for over 15 years. I also graduated from my Master degree in Health Administration (M.H.A.) at UNSW, and further pursued my interests in studying in pain medicine & management as well as assistive equipment & technology for my patients with variety of impairments and disabilities. I am also a licensed real estate agent and an auctioneer.</p>
					<p>I enjoy indoor sports like squash, table tennis and badminton, as well as outdoor sports like snow skiing. I also enjoy my quiet time watching good movies and TV shows, and of course traveling with my family and friends. My latest hobby is about to start my veggie patch. I also speak fluent Cantonese.</p>
					<p>My curiosity in I.T. was reignited from my early interests in personal computing and computer language BASIC in 1980s when I got my email address with Hotmail in 1990s, and wondered not only how world wide web worked but how ‘www’ would take our future into.</p>
					<p>In my medical practice in rehabilitation medicine, I expose to pioneering technology in healthcare for patients, from emerging personal assistive technology to automation and integration into living environment. I also researched the use of interactive computer assistive technology such as Nintendo VViiTM and XBOXTM for my patients’ therapy with some but limited success, and concluded that it was partly due to inappropriate user interface.</p>
					<p>I tried and changed over to Makey MakeyTM and adapted the user interface to suit my patients’ limited abilities and achieved better outcomes. Therefore, I would like to explore further in user interface in I.T. industry for my patient cohort. </p>
